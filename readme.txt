# Pass 1 Assembly Program

This project is a pass 1 assembly program written in C. The purpose of the program is to read a file containing a SIC (Simplified Instructional Computer) program line by line, and insert the symbol names into a symbol table while keeping track of the current address and starting address. The program updates the current address after processing all instructions and operations, while ensuring that the values obtained are within the specifications of the SIC program format. The program also checks the file being read for any errors. At the end of the program, the symbol table and total memory used for the program are displayed.

## Technologies Used:

- C programming language
